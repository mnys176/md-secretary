Commands:
    contents <project-name>
        Displays a rundown of every project in a notebook. This rundown
        includes its title, timeline, and abstract.

    create <project-name>
        Creates a new project folder structure in the notebook taking a
        project name for an argument. The resulting project will be a
        folder with the same name (sanitized to be "filesystem-
        friendly"). Within the project, a media folder, project file,
        and its first month folder will also be created. If a project
        with the same name already exists, creation will fail.

    extend <project-name>
        Extends an existing project by adding a month folder structure
        to it. The created month folder will contain a log file and
        summary file. If a project with the given name doesn't exist,
        the command will fail.

    scrap <project-name>
        Deletes an existing project after confirming with the user. If a
        project with the given name doesn't exist, the command will
        fail.

    ingest <path-to-json>
        Builds a project from a JSON file generated by the `compress`
        command and adds it to a notebook. If the given JSON file does
        not exist, the command will fail. If a project with the name
        derived from the JSON file already exists, the command will
        indicate the conflict to the user and confirm with them that
        they want to overwrite the existing version.

    compress <project-name>
        Generates a JSON file that describes the current state of a
        project with the given name. This can be useful for sharing long
        projects between notebooks. All media will be encoded as Base64.
        If no project with the given name exists, the command will fail.

    help
        Displays this help message and exists.
